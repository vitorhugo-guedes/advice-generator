## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass using Scss syntax
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

In this project i learned how to use scss to facilitate my development process, keep the code more organized and how to build a page from scratch following a design.
Also, i practiced my semantic html and practiced consuming api with fetch.

### Continued development

I plan continue practicing SCSS and JS skills related to consume apis, because i just started using sass and i didnt use all of the tools available i also want to take more complex projects.

### Useful resources

- [Sass Tutorial Freecodecamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a5j7KoflTs) - This tutorial really helped me understand sass and how to use its features.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/) - MDN docs helps me a lot in all my projects.
